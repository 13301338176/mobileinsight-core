Goal:
1. Some APIs to faciliate the trace collection. With the APIs, the user can customize the trace as follows:
	timestamp GPS_location signaling_msg android_log
2. Trace analytical tools

todo list:
1. Survey timestamp alignment between signaling message and Android logs?
	Also summerize the result in documentation.
2. Can we control which message the UE sends using QXDM (e.g., reject some requests from network; emulate some measurement reports to trigger handover; etc.)
3. Survey GPS: can we associate logs with the location we collect them?
4. Investigate how to decode ASN.1 and NAS messages (for WCDMA/LTE) using Wireshark. (@anoddnumber)
5. Usage case study: how the cross-layer analytics can help identify problems?
	- Start from the scenarios we are familiar with
	- Paper surveys, particularly papers on how RRC inactivity timers affect application performance
	- Survey data anlyatic systems (e.g., MapReduce, Spark, etc.)
