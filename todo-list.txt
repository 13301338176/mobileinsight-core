Goal:
1. Some APIs to faciliate the trace collection. With the APIs, the user can customize the trace as follows:
	timestamp GPS_location signaling_msg android_log
2. Trace analytical tools


1. Survey timestamp alignment between signaling message and Android logs?
  Also summerize the result in documentation.
2. Survey GPS: can we associate logs with the location we collect them?
3. Can we control which message the UE sends (e.g., reject some requests from network; emulate some measurement reports to trigger handover; etc.)
4. Investigate how to decode ASN.1 and NAS messages (for WCDMA/LTE) using Wireshark. (@anoddnumber)
