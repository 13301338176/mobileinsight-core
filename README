MobileInsight
==============


# Introduction #

MobileInsight is a cross-platform package for mobile network monitoring and analysis on end device. It is developed by UCLA Wireless Networking Group (WiNG) and OSU Mobile System, Security and Networking (MSSN) lab, licensed under Apache Licence 2.0.

MobileInsight provides low-level monitors for mobile network, and extensible event-driven analyzers for major cellular protocols, such as radio resource control (RRC), mobility management (EMM), and session management (ESM). You can also define your own analyzers for customized usage.


Typical usage of MobileInsight consists of declaring a monitor to track the network status and calling ananlyzer for online/offline analysis. See [overview](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu/mobile_insight/overview.html) on how this works, and [examples](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu/mobile_insight/examples.html) on how to use it.


# Installation #

Please see [here](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu/mobile_insight/get_started.html) for more detailed instructions. The following is a quick summary of installation:

First install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) if you do not have it.

Then download MobileInsight and unpack the code:

    tar -zxvf MobileInsight-2.2.tar.gz
    cd MobileInsight-2.2

For macOS users, install MobileInsight using:

    ./install-macos.sh (DO NOT EXECUTE WITH ROOT PRIVILEDGE!)

For Linux users, install MobileInsight using:

    ./install-ubuntu.sh (DO NOT EXECUTE WITH ROOT PRIVILEDGE!)

For Windows users, install MobileInsight using:

    python setup.py install

The auto install script will run an offline analysis example at the end.


# Dependencies #


Second, MobileInsight builds on top of `pyserial` and `crcmod`, so please install both libraries, for example, using `pip`:

    pip install pyserial
    pip install crcmod
    pip install matplotlib

    brew install wxpython

## Upgrade to New Version

Old version of mobileInsight-core may have installed Wireshark and Glib libraries under the `/usr/lib` folder.
It is recommended to remove them if you want to use the new version.
Please find the instruction below for different platforms.

Linux:

    rm /usr/lib/libwireshark.so*
    rm /usr/lib/libwiretap.so*
    rm /usr/lib/libwsutil.so*

macOS:

    rm /usr/lib/libwireshark.6.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libwireshark.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libwiretap.5.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libwiretap.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libwsutil.6.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libwsutil.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.dylib
    rm /usr/lib/libgobject-2.0.dylib
