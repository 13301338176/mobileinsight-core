MobileInsight
==============


# Introduction #

MobileInsight is a cross-platform package for mobile network monitoring and analysis on end device. It is developed by UCLA Wireless Networking Group (WiNG) and OSU Mobile System, Security and Networking (MSSN) lab, licensed under Apache Licence 2.0.

MobileInsight provides low-level monitors for mobile network, and extensible event-driven analyzers for major cellular protocols, such as radio resource control (RRC), mobility management (EMM), and session management (ESM). You can also define your own analyzers for customized usage.


Typical usage of MobileInsight consists of declaring a monitor to track the network status and calling ananlyzer for online/offline analysis. See [overview](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu/mobile_insight/overview.html) on how this works, and [examples](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu/mobile_insight/examples.html) on how to use it.
